                            When my wife and I had our first child staying organized got messy, literally. Dry-erase boards were a hassle. Bulletin boards got cluttered.
                            Most family planning apps were either too expensive or filled with ads.<br/>
                            As a software engineering student trying to make a big career change, I decided to build a better solution. Something simple, clean and
                            actually useful. I built Simplizity for <em>my</em> family using feedback from my wife and my mother every step of the way.<br/>

                            you focus on what really matters: your family.<br/>
